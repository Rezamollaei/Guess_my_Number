This JavaScript code creates a number-guessing game where the player guesses a number between 1 and 20. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. If the guess is correct, the score updates and the background color changes. The player can reset the game with the "again" button. The game tracks and displays the high score.
